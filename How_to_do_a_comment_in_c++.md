#How to do a comment in c++

For Single Line Comment - Just Put // in front of a line to make the rest of the line commented.

For Multiple Line Comment - Put /* before the text to mark the beginning of comment , and add /* after the ending of your text to make it commented.

###An example:

	// This is a sigle line comment
	
	/* This is 
	a multiple 
	/*line comment

	int n = 0; // Declare a int variable

	/* This function add two numbers
	and returns the results in a int
	variable */
	
	int add(int a, int b){
		return a+b;
	}
